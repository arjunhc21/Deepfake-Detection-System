Deepfake Detection System

This project is about teaching a computer to spot fake videos made using AI (also called deepfakes).

Think of it like this 👇
	•	You see a video of a famous person saying something shocking.
	•	But in reality, they never said it — the video was AI-generated.
	•	How do we know if it’s real or fake?

That’s exactly what this project does — it looks at videos closely and tells us if they’re real or manipulated.

🚀 What’s Inside
	•	📂 A notebook (deepfaek2.ipynb) with the detection code.
	•	🖼️ Frame-by-frame analysis of videos.
	•	👀 Facial landmark tracking (eyes, mouth, expressions, etc.).
	•	🧠 Deep learning models that catch tiny inconsistencies.
	•	⚡ Ability to flag a video as real or fake.

🛠 Tools I Used
	•	Python (the main language)
	•	TensorFlow (for deep learning models)
	•	OpenCV (for image and video processing)
	•	NumPy & Pandas (for handling data)
	•	Matplotlib (for visualizations)

🔍 Why This Matters

Deepfakes are getting harder to detect with the human eye. They can be used for:
	•	Misinformation & fake news
	•	Identity theft & scams
	•	Harmful or misleading media

By building this system, I wanted to explore how AI can fight AI — using machine learning to protect us from manipulated content.
